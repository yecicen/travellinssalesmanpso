Solving Travelling-Salesman problem with Particle Swarm Optimization



## Given Problem

With the disruptive technologies are growth over years, an Industry 4.0 revolution has begun. And a company manager wants to join this flow. Therefore he is planning to set a new factory that made up with 3D Printers. He is currently manufacturing tires for cars, therefore he wants to set this new factory for tires. A tire is made up with 10 different parts. Therefore he put 10 3D printers to factory. Each printer has different size, therefore different location. Manager wonders that what is the best route for single product that will operated on all printers. The locations of printers are P0(30,191), P1(52,178), P2(85,189), P3(200,200), P4(44,146) , P5(94,137), P6(70,93), P7(169,72), P8(30,30) and P9(89,18). For this problem what is the shortest route and order of the printers?
